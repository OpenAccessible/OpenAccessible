 /**
 * OpenAccessible - SAAS-Ready Accessibility Widget
 * Single-file embeddable widget: Color, Dyslexia/Dictionary, Contrast, Language,
 * Size, Cursor, Highlight, TTS, Text Align, Screen Reader/Braille support & more.
 * @license AGPL-3.0
 * @version 1.0.0
 *
 * Structure:
 * - defaultState / state: user preferences (persisted to localStorage unless guestMode)
 * - API: optional backend (apiBase) for dictionary, TTS, translate, preferences
 * - translateApiUrl: optional LibreTranslate-style endpoint (default OSS Translate); fallback apiBase then MyMemory
 * - Panel: settings UI; toolbar: floating button + position
 * - Dictionary: double-click word -> modal with word, definition, and Play word/Play definition audio
 * - TTS: browser SpeechSynthesis or server for Read page, Speak selection, dictionary modal
 *
 * Features:
 * - Mute sound: when enabled, all TTS and audio playback is suppressed (Test voice still plays for preview).
 * - Voice: select from all browser voices (grouped by language); "Test voice" plays a sample.
 * - Voice navigation: optional SpeechRecognition for hands-free commands (open/close, read page, stop, etc.).
 * - Keyboard: Alt+A (Windows) / Option+A (Mac) to open/close; Escape to close; Tab/focus trap in panel; R/S in panel for Read/Stop.
 * - Presets: built-in (High contrast, Reading, Minimal, Focus) and user-saved presets; apply via dropdown or API.
 * - Translation: OSS Translate (LibreTranslate API), then apiBase action=translate, then MyMemory; chunked for long text.
 * - Extended languages: LANGUAGES list for TTS language and Translate target (40+ languages).
 * - Utilities: debounce, throttle, getPreferredColorScheme, getPreferredReducedMotion, hasAccessibleLabel, getControlLabel.
 * - Public API: init() returns { getState, setState, openPanel, closePanel, reset, stopTTS, getPresets, applyPreset, saveCurrentAsPreset, deletePreset, showKeyboardShortcuts, showAbout, translate, version, events }.
 * - Events: openaccessible:ready, openaccessible:change, openaccessible:preset:apply, openaccessible:tts:start, openaccessible:tts:stop, openaccessible:translate:start, openaccessible:translate:done.

   * Code flow overview (for maintainers):
   * - State: defaultState holds all preference keys; state is the live object, persisted to localStorage (unless guestMode).
   * - readStorage/writeStorage: load/save state; writeStorage is called after applyFromPanel and when state is updated programmatically.
   * - Presets: getSavedPresets/setSavedPresets read/write user presets; applyPreset applies built-in or saved; saveCurrentAsPreset adds a new saved preset.
   * - fetchWithTimeout: optional wrapper for fetch with AbortController timeout and retries; can be used by API calls.
   * - getFocusableElements/trapFocus: used for modals and panel focus trap; getPanelFocusables/setupPanelFocusTrap are panel-specific.
   * - showKeyboardShortcuts/showAbout: create dialogs with KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS and version info; close on Escape or button.
   * - buildLanguageOptions: builds <option> elements from LANGUAGES for language and translateTargetLang selects.
   * - applyToDocument: applies state to $root (classes, styles, font-size, filter, etc.) and calls applyFormLabelHints when highlightForms is on.
   * - applyFormLabelHints: when state.highlightForms is true, adds aria-describedby and a screen-reader-only span for form controls without labels.
   * - normalizeInitOptions: sanitizes init(opts) so apiBase, apiKey, translateApiUrl, etc. are safe strings or defaults.
   * - requestTranslate: tries translateApiUrl (LibreTranslate format), then apiBase?action=translate, then MyMemory; calls onDone(translatedText or null).
   * - requestTranslateChunked: splits long text with splitTextIntoChunks, translates each chunk, concatenates results.
   * - getHeadingsSummary/getImagesWithoutAlt/getFormFieldsWithoutLabels/getAccessibilitySummary: return data for host or dashboards.
   * - Public API: init() returns an object with getState, setState, openPanel, closePanel, reset, stopTTS, getPresets, applyPreset, saveCurrentAsPreset,
   *   deletePreset, showKeyboardShortcuts, showAbout, translate, getHeadingsSummary, getImagesWithoutAlt, getFormFieldsWithoutLabels,
